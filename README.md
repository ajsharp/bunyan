Bunyan
======
Bunyan is a thin ruby wrapper around a MongoDB [capped collection](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Capped+Collections), 
created with high-performance, flexible logging in mind.

Install
=======
    gem install bunyan

Configure
=========
The only configuration options required are the database and collection name.

For rails apps, puts the config block in an initializer.

    # config/initializers/bunyan.rb
    Bunyan::Logger.configure do |config|
      # required options
      config.database   'bunyan_logger'
      config.collection 'development_log'

      # optional
      config.disabled true
    end

Usage
=====
You can access the bunyan logger anywhere is your app via Bunyan::Logger.
The Logger class is implemented as a singleton, and you can call any instance
method on the Logger class. This is implemented with some method_missing magic,
which is explained in a bit more detail below.

Internals
=========
Bunyan makes heavy usage of method\_missing both at the class and instance level.
At the class level, this is purely for convenience to pass missing class methods
to the singleton instance, which precludes us from needing to use Logger.instance
directly. At the instance level, method\_missing is used to provide a very thin
layer around MongoDB, via the Mongo driver.

The net effect of this is that there is no reason to muck around with 
calling methods directly on Bunyan::Logger.instance, because all methods that 
don't already exist at the class level will be sent to Bunyan::Logger.instance.

    Bunyan::Logger.count == Bunyan::Logger.instance.count # => true

Also, you can call any instance methods Bunyan::Logger that you would otherwise 
call on a Mongo collection object.
